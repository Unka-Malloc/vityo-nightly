# Vityo Core Completion Audit

**Purpose:** Record the Vityo Core Completion Audit reference material for Vityo architecture, release, or maintenance work.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-17

This audit maps the active core implementation objective to concrete artifacts and verification evidence. It is intentionally stricter than a test summary: a passing test suite is evidence only when it covers the stated requirement.

## 1. Objective Restated As Deliverables

```text
1. Complete the environment foundation chain:
   Foundation <- Platform Manager <- Platform Adapter <- Platform Context <- Platform Detector

2. Complete Configuration + Toolchain.

3. Implement a functionally complete Language Service.
```

For this audit, "complete" means:

| Deliverable | Success criteria |
|---|---|
| Foundation | Provides reusable DataStore, resource coordination, credential storage, and shared base contracts without depending on higher layers. |
| Platform Detector | Produces platform component facts from probers without owning higher-level behavior. |
| Platform Context | Stores composable platform facts such as file system, shell, process, network, resource, clipboard, notification, local service, and PTY facts. |
| Platform Adapter | Converts platform facts into compatibility decisions without direct product behavior. |
| Platform Manager | Exposes system-specific managers that functional layers can call without talking to raw OS APIs directly. |
| Configuration | Persists IDE settings, shell/environment overlays, credentials, and Toolchain catalog state through Foundation/DataStore. |
| Toolchain | Resolves, configures, verifies, runs, and reports generic IDE-owned tools; system Styio is consumed through its machine contract. |
| Language Service | Connects to real Styio language truth, caches project-context results, exposes diagnostics/completion/hover/semantic/reference/rename facts, and keeps UI fallback clearly separated from compiler truth. |

## 2. Prompt-To-Artifact Checklist

| Language Service connects to Styio CLI diagnostics | `styio_service_connector.dart`, `styio_service_runtime.dart` | Connector, runtime, fixture gate, and language status tests pass. | Covered for current CLI diagnostics path. |
| Language Service can consume published Styio facts envelopes and explicit capability states | `styio_service_connector.dart`, `styio_service_capability_detector.dart`, `STYIO-SERVICE-PROTOCOL-CONTRACT.md`, `test/fixtures/styio_service/facts_envelope.jsonl` | Connector/capability filtered test -> `+8 All tests passed`; language status surface test -> `+6 All tests passed`. | Covered for Vityo-side future facts ingestion and capability declaration contract. |
| Language result cache is project-context aware | `styio_service_connector.dart`, `styio_service_project_document_rule_provider.dart` | `test/language_result_cache_context_binding_test.dart` and project provider tests passed in focused language suite. | Covered. |
| Diagnostics surface can consume service output | Routed/cached language service, editor status widgets | Full Flutter test passed, including language service status widget and smoke tests. | Covered for current service/fallback output. |
| Completion/hover/semantic/reference/rename consume real Styio facts | Language service payload/fact adapters, semantic snapshot, editor features | UI and fallback feature tests pass, but current real Styio CLI does not emit observed JSONL facts for completion, hover, semantic tokens, symbols, or references. | Not complete as real StyioService capability. |
| Full frontend tests pass after latest core changes | `products/vityo_app` | `flutter test` -> `+844 ~9 All tests passed`. | Covered for Flutter frontend. |
| Full repo delivery gates pass | Repo-level scripts, docs gates, CI gates | Not run in this audit. | Not complete. |

## 4. Explicit Non-Completion Items

| Gap | Why it prevents completion | Next concrete action |
|---|---|---|
| Real StyioService semantic facts are absent from current CLI output. | Vityo can route/cache/display facts, but completion/hover/semantic/reference/rename cannot be called functionally complete until facts come from Styio language truth. | Integrate the embedded/API/LSP contract once `styio-nightly` exposes semantic facts. |
| Clipboard, Notification, and Local Service managers have only bundle-level/product-agnostic evidence. | The Platform Manager set is complete and audited, but these managers do not yet have concrete upper-layer product workflows. | Add product-path tests when clipboard, notification, or local-service consumers are implemented. |
| Full repo delivery gates have not been run. | Flutter tests do not cover docs gates, repo hygiene, or any external delivery checks. | Run repo-level delivery gates when the implementation scope is ready for closure. |

## 5. Safe Status Statement

The current state is:

```text
Foundation, Platform, Configuration, and Toolchain have substantial implemented surfaces with passing focused and frontend-wide tests.
Toolchain managed-download provenance now has Ed25519 verifier and catalog/config metadata support.
Language Service is strong on Vityo-side routing, caching, UI integration, and fallback features, but it is not functionally complete against real Styio language truth until upstream StyioService emits semantic facts.
The active objective must not be marked complete yet.
```
