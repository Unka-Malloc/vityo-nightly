# Dependency Usage Boundary

**Purpose:** Record dependency authorization boundaries for `Vityo`.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-04

`Vityo` is an Apache-2.0 Flutter/Dart application source project. Its current app, prototype, runner, docs, and test dependency boundary is:

## Runtime Dependencies

## Prototype Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | License | Source Boundary | Usage Boundary | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Build / CI / Platform Toolchain Dependencies

| Dependency | Source | Classification |
|---|---|---|

| Flutter SDK (3.41.x) | System / CI image | Build |

## UI Assets

UI assets must remain covered by documented open-source asset evidence before promotion into product surfaces. Asset sources and licenses are tracked in `docs/assets/INDEX.md`.

Bundled product fonts (declared in `products/vityo_app/pubspec.yaml`, stored in `products/vityo_app/assets/fonts/` with their license texts):

| Asset | Version | License | Source Boundary | Usage Boundary | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plus Jakarta Sans (TTF 400/500/600/700/800) | google/fonts `ofl/plusjakartasans` | OFL-1.1 (`assets/fonts/OFL-PlusJakartaSans.txt`) | Google Fonts distribution of the Tokotype release | Product UI text family across desktop, web, and mobile surfaces | Runtime asset |
| Azeret Mono (TTF 400/500/600) | google/fonts `ofl/azeretmono` | OFL-1.1 (`assets/fonts/OFL-AzeretMono.txt`) | Google Fonts distribution | Code, terminal, status-bar, and keycap text | Runtime asset |

## Policy Rules

1. **No commercial/paid/proprietary dependencies.** No dependency may require commercial authorization, paid licensing, subscription access, membership access, trial-only terms, proprietary-use approval, or private registry access.
2. **Pre-registration required.** Any future dependency must be listed here with its license evidence, source boundary, and usage boundary before it can pass audit.
3. **Prototype isolation.** Prototype-only dependencies must stay prototype-scoped and must not become product runtime requirements without this file being updated.
4. **SDK exceptions.** Flutter SDK and Dart SDK dependencies are granted blanket authorization as platform-provided SDK components.
5. **Gate enforcement.** The `scripts/dependency-policy-gate.py` script enforces that every `pubspec.yaml` dependency (excluding SDK deps) has a corresponding entry in this file.
6. **License evidence required.** Each non-SDK dependency must carry a recognized SPDX license identifier or explicit license evidence.
7. **Generated reports.** Generated reports and gate summaries must summarize dependency, UI asset, and license evidence without copying target repository source.
