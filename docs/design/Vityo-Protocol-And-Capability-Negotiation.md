# Vityo Protocol and Capability Negotiation

**Purpose:** Define versioning and capability-negotiation rules across Vityo adapter contracts and the IDE-to-Agent protocol without assigning model/provider ownership to the IDE.

**Owner:** Adapter contracts owner (`CODEOWNERS` → adapter-contracts domain)

## 1. Design Principles

1. **Every contract has a schema version.** No implicit or unversioned protocols.
2. **Capability negotiation is explicit.** Both sides declare capabilities; the intersection determines behavior.
3. **Unknown fields are tolerated.** Decoders must not fail on unknown fields — forward compatibility is required.
4. **Blocked reasons are surfaced.** When a capability is unavailable, the reason must be machine-readable.
5. **Revisions are tracked.** Every payload carries a source revision or snapshot ID for staleness detection.

## 2. Universal Contract Schema

Every Vityo adapter contract conforms to this envelope:

```dart
class VersionedContract {
  final int schemaVersion;           // Contract schema version (monotonic)
  final Map<String, bool> capabilities;  // Capability flags
  final String? sourceRevision;      // Source revision or snapshot ID
  final Map<String, dynamic> extensions;  // Unknown field tolerance bucket
}
```

### 2.1 Schema Version Rules

1. **Major version bump** (e.g., 1 → 2): Breaking changes to required fields.
2. **Minor version bump** (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1): New optional fields added.
3. **Patch version bump** (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Documentation or validation changes only.

### 2.2 Capability Negotiation

Each contract declares a set of capability flags. The effective capability set is the **intersection** of what the client requests and what the server supports.

```dart
class CapabilityNegotiation {
  final Map<String, CapabilityStatus> requested;
  final Map<String, CapabilityStatus> resolved;
  final List<BlockedCapability> blocked;  // Capabilities that couldn't be satisfied
}

class CapabilityStatus {
  final bool supported;
  final String? version;            // Optional version of the capability
  final String? degradedReason;     // Why it's degraded (if supported but limited)
}

class BlockedCapability {
  final String capability;
  final String reason;              // Machine-readable reason code
  final String message;             // Human-readable explanation
}
```

## 3. Adapter Contracts

### 3.1 LanguageServiceAdapter

```dart
class LanguageServiceContract {
  final int schemaVersion;
  final Map<String, bool> capabilities;  // hover, completion, definition, references, rename, etc.
  final String languageId;
  final String sourceRevision;
  final Map<String, dynamic> extensions;
}
```

### 3.2 ProjectGraphAdapter

```dart
class ProjectGraphContract {
  final int schemaVersion;
  final Map<String, bool> capabilities;  // dependency-graph, module-map, build-targets
  final String projectRoot;
  final String sourceRevision;
  final Map<String, dynamic> extensions;
}
```

class ExecutionContract {
  final int schemaVersion;
  final Map<String, bool> capabilities;  // compile, run, test, debug
  final String targetId;
  final String sourceRevision;
  final Map<String, dynamic> extensions;
}
```

class RuntimeEventContract {
  final int schemaVersion;

  final String executionId;
  final String sourceRevision;
  final Map<String, dynamic> extensions;
}
```

### 3.5 DebugWorkbenchContract

```dart
class DebugWorkbenchContract {
  final int schemaVersion;
  final Map<String, bool> capabilities;  // launch, attach, breakpoint, step, evaluate, output
  final String adapterId;
  final String sourceRevision;
  final DebugSessionLifecycle lifecycle;
  final Map<String, dynamic> extensions;
}

enum DebugSessionLifecycle { idle, launching, attaching, running, paused, terminated, detached }
```

### 3.6 Vityo Agent Protocol

Vityo's Agent boundary is the versioned JSON-RPC/ACP contract in
`packages/vityo_agent_protocol`. It covers initialization, session creation/loading, prompts,
cancellation, session updates, permission requests, and negotiated Vityo capability extensions.
Compatible Agents use the same authorized capabilities. ACP v1 `fs/read_text_file` and
`fs/write_text_file` cover client-managed files; `terminal/create`, `terminal/output`,
`terminal/wait_for_exit`, `terminal/kill`, and `terminal/release` cover supported process
interaction. Vityo advertises these methods only when the IDE has a real scoped operation route.
The client routes them through the typed local daemon session gateway and a neutral IDE dispatcher
to the selected open-buffer, workspace transaction, and PTY owners. Source-aware atomic edits use
the existing revision-bound Vityo proposal extension.

Ownership rules:

1. Vityo is the protocol client and owns the workspace revision, scoped context export, permission
   presentation, change preview, and transaction result.
2. Vityo Coding Agent or another compatible Agent is the protocol server/runtime and owns
   model/provider routing, context selection, tool loops, Agent policy, durable sessions, and
   multi-Agent orchestration.
3. Protocol requests reach source or process state only through advertised, authorized client
   operations and their owning services. They never grant the Agent direct access to IDE buffers,
   Flutter widgets, or workspace mutation primitives.
4. No Agent connection is a valid IDE state. It does not block editing, language service, build,
   test, run, or observation.
5. Provider-specific contracts are runtime-internal and must not become IDE adapter contracts.

This document describes ownership only. It does not change the current protocol messages, schema,
or wire compatibility.

### 3.7 SourceControlAdapter

```dart
class SourceControlContract {
  final int schemaVersion;
  final Map<String, bool> capabilities;  // status, diff, commit, branch, push, pull
  final String branchIdentity;
  final String sourceRevision;       // HEAD commit hash
  final bool workspaceDirty;
  final Map<String, dynamic> extensions;
}
```

Reference: `products/vityo_app/lib/src/ide/workspace/source_control_adapter.dart`

## 4. Unknown Field Tolerance

All contract decoders MUST follow these rules:

1. When decoding, unknown JSON keys are stored in the `extensions` map, never discarded.
2. When re-encoding, the `extensions` map is serialized alongside known fields.
3. This ensures that a newer producer → older consumer → newer producer round-trip preserves all data.

**Test requirement:** Every adapter payload MUST have a test that:
1. Serializes a payload with extra unknown fields
2. Deserializes and verifies the unknown fields are preserved in `extensions`
3. Re-serializes and verifies the unknown fields are present in output

## 5. Stale Revision Detection

Every contract payload carries a `sourceRevision`:

- For language services: the document version or content hash
- For project graphs: the workspace state hash
- For execution: the execution ID
- For debug: the debug session ID
- For source control: the HEAD commit hash

**Rule:** If a consumer receives a payload with a `sourceRevision` older than the last processed revision, it MUST treat the payload as stale and either:
1. Request a fresh payload, or
2. Apply the payload with a staleness warning

## 6. Degraded and Blocked Capabilities

### 6.1 Degraded Capability

A capability is **degraded** when it is supported but with limitations:

```dart
{
  "capability": "completion",
  "supported": true,
  "degradedReason": "completion-limited-to-100-tokens"
}
```

### 6.2 Blocked Capability

A capability is **blocked** when it cannot be satisfied:

```dart
{
  "capability": "debug-attach",
  "reason": "no-debug-adapter-available",
  "message": "No debug adapter is configured for this language."
}
```

Blocked reasons are machine-readable codes, not free-form text. Standard codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `no-adapter` | No adapter registered for this capability |
| `no-provider` | No provider configured |
| `no-network` | Network unavailable |
| `no-toolchain` | Required toolchain not installed |
| `no-permission` | User has not granted permission |
| `unsupported-platform` | Platform does not support this capability |
| `feature-flag-disabled` | Feature flag is off |
| `stale-revision` | Source revision is too old |

## 7. Backward Compatibility Rules

1. **New optional fields are always allowed.** Older consumers ignore them.
2. **Required fields cannot be removed** without a major schema version bump.
3. **Field types cannot change** without a major schema version bump.
4. **Enum values can be added** but existing values cannot be removed or renumbered.
5. **Capability flags can be added** at any time; removing a flag requires a minor version bump.
6. **All decoders must accept and preserve unknown fields.**

## 8. Testing Requirements

| Test | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| `protocol_capability_negotiation_test.dart` | Capability intersection, blocked reasons, degraded capabilities |
| `debug_workbench_contract_test.dart` | Debug contract serialization, lifecycle states, capability negotiation |
| `source_control_adapter_test.dart` | SC contract, dirty workspace detection, branch identity |
| Per-contract serialization tests | Unknown fields, stale revision, backward compat |

Every adapter contract test must verify:
1. Schema version is present and parseable
2. Capabilities map is non-null
3. Unknown fields are preserved in `extensions`
4. Blocked reasons use standard codes
5. Stale revision is detectable
