# Maintenance Tools

**Purpose:** Define the current Vityo maintenance tool and skill inventory that release gates must verify before publishing.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-03

## Source

The machine-readable source of truth is:

```bash
toolchain/maintenance-tools.json
```

`python3 scripts/release-readiness-gate.py --skip-build` validates this file during release readiness checks.

The canonical local and CI delivery tool is `python3 scripts/vityo.py deliver`, with independently
callable privacy, architecture, test, coverage, build, install, and launch stages. The Rust/Cargo
toolchain is pinned to `1.88.0` in CI; the `test` stage prepares `llvm-tools-preview` and verifies
or installs the pinned `cargo-llvm-cov` `0.9.0` before Rust coverage collection. Direct lower-level
coverage-helper calls require both tools to be ready. Locked dependency notices use the project-local
pinned `cargo-about` tool. The architecture stage checks the maintained model and generated views with
`python3 scripts/vityo_architecture.py --check`. The registered Rust coverage helper collects or
evaluates the separate Coding Agent and daemon reports; the notice helper checks the supported
native-target locked Cargo graphs. Their installation and usage boundaries are recorded in
[Dependency Usage](../../../DEPENDENCY-USAGE.md).

## Policy

1. Every listed tool and skill must be `current`.
2. The inventory uses `current-only` policy and forbids stale support modes.
3. Every listed tool must point at a repository file that exists.
4. Every skill must be backed by at least one listed tool.
5. Every maintained module or business line must list at least one maintenance tool.
6. Release readiness fails when the inventory is missing, stale, internally inconsistent, or not updated to the release tooling policy date.

## Maintained Lines

The release gate requires coverage for:

1. Adapter / Contracts
2. Coordination
3. Docs / Delivery
4. Foundation / Environment
5. Module / Platform
6. Runtime / Agent
7. Shell / Editor
8. Theme / UX

## Update Flow

1. Add, remove, or replace tools in `toolchain/maintenance-tools.json`.
2. Keep only tools that are useful for development, release, or operations maintenance.
3. Update the affected team runbook when a tool changes a team's daily workflow.
4. Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/release-readiness-gate.py --skip-build
```
