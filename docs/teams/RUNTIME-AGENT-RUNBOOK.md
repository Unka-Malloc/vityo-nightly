# Runtime / Agent Runbook

**Purpose:** Define ownership for runtime/debug surfaces and the IDE-side Agent Workbench without assigning Agent-runtime execution to the IDE.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-08

## Mission

Own runtime/debug presentation, the Agent Client projection, and the Agent Workbench. This team
does not own model/provider routing, Agent tool loops, durable Agent sessions, or multi-Agent
orchestration; those belong to the compatible Agent runtime.

## Owned Surface

Pending Agent terminal output and exit waits settle when the session is cancelled or
closed, the terminal is released, the operation port closes, or the daemon transport
disconnects. These lifecycle transitions do not impose a wall-clock execution limit.

Primary paths:

1. `products/vityo_app/lib/src/view_ide/runtime/`
2. `products/vityo_app/lib/src/ide/agent_client/`
   - `agent_client_registry.dart` — thin daemon gateway, immutable session projections, permission presentation, and reconnect coalescing
   - `mcp/vityod_mcp_gateway.dart` — typed access to daemon-owned root-scoped tools and grants
   - `native/vityod/crates/vityod-agent-host/` — bounded ACP process lifecycle, correlation, capability enforcement, and orphan-free shutdown
3. `products/vityo_app/lib/src/ide/workbench/agent_collaboration/`
4. `products/vityo_app/lib/src/presentation/agent_workbench/`
5. `products/vityo_app/lib/src/view_render/runtime/`
6. `products/vityo_app/lib/src/runtime/`
   - `runtime_event_log.dart` — append-only runtime event log with ring buffer projection
Review dependency, not an owned path:

1. `products/vityo_coding_agent/src/` — independent Rust runtime; see the [Agent Runtime Runbook](./AGENT-RUNTIME-RUNBOOK.md).
2. `packages/vityo_agent_protocol/`

Key SSOTs:

1. `产品规格 -> ../design/Vityo-Product-Spec.md`
2. `系统架构 -> ../design/Vityo-System-Architecture.md`
3. `测试目录 -> ../assets/workflow/TEST-CATALOG.md`

## Daily Workflow

Flow Hero Run/Test readiness requires the actual selected Pafio/Styio compiler
check. A failed rerun clears the current result and never reuses a previous receipt.
The compile-only acceptance entry uses the production UI/controller/execution path
with Agent attachment disabled before provider or credential access.

1. 先确认当前变更是 runtime 可视化还是 Agent 协作入口。
2. 若变更依赖新 adapter payload，先转到 Adapter / Contracts owner 文档确认边界。
3. Treat `Agent Workbench` as the formal capability. `Agent Panel` may remain a concrete view name,
   but it must show task plan, permission, changes, and verification state rather than define the
   product as chat.
4. ProfileSync is a future provider-neutral schema owned by Adapter / Contracts, not a current
   runtime surface. Do not add model/provider credentials or Agent-runtime prompt configuration to
   IDE-owned state.
5. Do not add provider routes, provider SDKs, model credentials, tool loops, policy stores,
   durable-session stores, or multi-Agent orchestration to the IDE. The Coding Agent is the
   independent Rust ACP process; the shared Dart protocol package remains its client binding.
6. runtime replay、debug lane 和 hosted execution 摘要必须消费 `view_ide/backend_toolchain` adapter payload，不得回读已移除入口或上游 human stderr。
7. IDE-side Agent presentation belongs to `ide/agent_client`, collaboration projections to
   `ide/workbench/agent_collaboration`, and Flutter presentation to
   `presentation/agent_workbench`; `vityod` supervises the ACP process and owns daemon workspace
   and process services, while the independent Rust Agent owns provider, policy, loop, and session
   state.
8. UI surfaces may display only redacted protocol context and receipt summaries. Preserve supplied
   ACP permission `optionId`/`name`/`kind` and return the selected ID exactly. Review source-change
   proposals as a correlated diff and commit through the existing workspace transaction owner;
   details live in the [security and supply-chain policy](../governance/SECURITY-AND-SUPPLY-CHAIN.md).
9. Protocol permission/change semantics or IDE MCP/tool-security changes must update
   [../governance/SECURITY-AND-SUPPLY-CHAIN.md](../governance/SECURITY-AND-SUPPLY-CHAIN.md).

10. `runtime_event_log.dart` changes must keep replay output deterministic on Windows and POSIX hosts; avoid path separator, line-ending, or clock assumptions in runtime event summaries and tests.
11. Agent context may compose Pafio metadata, Styio machine facts, and Platform
    hosted facts only through their formal adapters; it must not expose Pafio
    private storage or suggest removed compiler-management commands.

## Change Classes

1. Small: 局部 panel 状态、展示文案或执行态摘要修正。运行 Flutter 最小验证。
2. Medium: runtime summary, Agent Client connection, Agent Workbench behavior,
   hosted execution replay, or disconnected-Agent state. Update the test catalog.
3. High: protocol semantics, workspace change application, or the IDE/Agent ownership boundary.
   Require architecture and security review.

## Required Gates

Minimum:

```bash
cd products/vityo_app && flutter analyze && flutter test
python3 scripts/check_security_baseline.py
python3 scripts/repo-hygiene-gate.py --mode tracked
```

## Cross-Team Dependencies

1. Adapter / Contracts 必须 review 任何 adapter payload、schema 或 handoff 语义变化。
2. Module / Platform 必须 review 会影响 capability gating、平台差异或分发限制的变更。
3. Theme / UX 必须 review 面板层级、窄屏布局或状态可见性变化。
4. Docs / Delivery 必须 review 测试目录、规格或里程碑映射更新。

## Handoff / Recovery

Record:

1. 受影响的 surface 是 runtime、debug 还是 agent。
2. 当前依赖的 adapter 能力快照和 fallback 路径。
3. 已更新的 schema 或测试目录条目。
4. 下一个阻塞点、回滚点与 history 链接。

2026-09-05: Migrated generic runtime-event intake and replay-summary keys to Styio runtime-events v2 (`from_phase`/`to_phase`; retired v1 `message`/`file`/`thread_id` reads). Runtime surface still degrades unknown v2 kinds. No `prototype/` change.

2026-10-08: Runtime task records retain optional `inheritsHostEnvironment`
provenance separately from redacted environment maps. Process request omission is
true, an explicit map is false, and historical/manual/PTY records without this fact
remain unknown. Copies, JSON, and runtime snapshot metadata preserve that state;
no host values are read or added to the record. Execution and extension sandbox
maps remain explicit at the Process Manager boundary.
