# Architecture Runbook

**Purpose:** Define the architecture domain owner's responsibilities, owned paths, review checklist, and required gates for Vityo system architecture governance.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-03

## Mission

Own the overall Styio system architecture: layer boundaries, import rules, adapter contract schemas, architecture alignment with mainstream IDE patterns, architecture decision records (ADRs), and the implemented-decision summary. Enforce that `view_ide` does not import Flutter presentation, Coding Agent stays independent of IDE/Flutter implementation, and cross-product messages use the shared protocol.

## Owned Surface

Primary paths:
1. `docs/design/Vityo-Mainstream-Architecture-Alignment.md`
2. `docs/design/Vityo-System-Architecture.md`
3. `docs/design/Vityo-Protocol-And-Capability-Negotiation.md`
4. `docs/design/Vityo-Extension-And-Contribution-Model.md`
5. `docs/design/Vityo-Agent-Native-IDE-Architecture.md`
6. `docs/adr/`
7. `docs/teams/ARCHITECTURE-RUNBOOK.md`
8. `docs/governance/`
9. `CODEOWNERS`
10. `scripts/check_architecture_boundaries.py`
11. `scripts/check_product_line_boundaries.py`

Key SSOTs:
1. `架构对齐 -> ../design/Vityo-Mainstream-Architecture-Alignment.md`
2. `系统架构 -> ../design/Vityo-System-Architecture.md`
3. `协议协商 -> ../design/Vityo-Protocol-And-Capability-Negotiation.md`
4. `API 兼容性 -> ../governance/API-COMPATIBILITY.md`
5. `供应链安全 -> ../governance/SECURITY-AND-SUPPLY-CHAIN.md`
6. `已实现决策摘要 -> ../adr/IMPLEMENTED-DECISIONS.md`

## Daily Workflow

Flow Hero consumes the registered Agent operation/lifecycle contract, platform launch-path
facade, workspace document contract, and platform workspace-store factory. Concrete
platform adapters stay behind that factory; transaction failures live in the public
document contract. Those entrypoints retain ownership in the IDE/daemon layers;
their registration does not allow arbitrary IDE implementation imports or Agent runtime
ownership in presentation.

1. Review PRs touching architecture-owned paths against the review checklist.
2. Run `python3 scripts/check_architecture_boundaries.py` on any `view_ide` / `view_render` changes.
3. Ensure new public models have schemaVersion fields.
4. Ensure new adapter payloads have capabilities maps and unknown field tolerance.
5. Verify no competitor brand names enter UI-visible strings.
6. Create standalone ADRs only for significant architectural decisions that still need direct review.
7. When a decision is implemented and absorbed by code and owner SSOTs, compress the durable result into `docs/adr/IMPLEMENTED-DECISIONS.md` instead of leaving a stale plan or one-off ADR trail.
8. Keep Vityo as one product with an IDE delivery track, a first-party companion-runtime track, and
   a shared protocol boundary; never recreate removed forwarding roots or dual product identities.
9. Reject model/provider, tool-loop, durable-session, or multi-Agent orchestration ownership in the
   IDE. Reject direct IDE workspace mutation by an Agent runtime.

## Change Classes

1. Small: New model/contract in existing domain, minor doc update. Run architecture boundary gate and flutter analyze.
2. Medium: New architecture doc, new ADR, implemented-decision summary update, new governance rule, layer boundary adjustment. Run full gate suite plus docs gate.
3. High: Layer boundary redefinition, major schema version bump, breaking contract change. Requires ADR or implemented-decision replacement, team review, and migration guide.

## Required Gates

Minimum:
```bash
python3 scripts/check_architecture_boundaries.py
python3 scripts/check_product_line_boundaries.py
python3 scripts/ide-product-parity-gate.py
python3 scripts/vityo-product-gate.py --mode checkpoint
cd products/vityo_app && flutter analyze
python3 scripts/repo-hygiene-gate.py --mode tracked
```

## Cross-Team Dependencies

1. Agent team must review agent architecture changes.
2. Module team must review extension/contribution model changes.
3. Adapter contracts team must review protocol and capability negotiation changes.
4. Editor/shell team must review view_ide/view_render boundary changes.
5. Governance team must review security and API compatibility changes.

## Handoff / Recovery

Record:
1. Which architecture docs were updated.
2. Which ADRs were created, superseded, or compressed into `IMPLEMENTED-DECISIONS.md`.
3. Which layer boundaries were adjusted.
4. Which gates were updated.
5. Next recovery point and pending architectural decisions.
