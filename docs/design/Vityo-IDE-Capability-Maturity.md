# Vityo Capability Maturity Model

**Purpose:** Define Vityo's own capability maturity levels. Each capability is assessed against Vityo's product trajectory, not against a competitor's feature list. "Like VSCode" or "like JetBrains" is never a maturity level.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-31

**Status:** Active maturity tracking

## 1. Maturity Levels

Vityo capability maturity is measured in six levels. A capability advances by crossing clear verification gates, not by accumulating features.

| Level | Name | Definition | Verification Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** | Stub / Decorative | A placeholder exists: enum value, empty class, hardcoded mock, or UI-only surface with no backend model. | Code compiles; no product behavior. |
| **L1** | Local Model | A repo-local model exists with unit tests. May use local heuristics or fixtures. Does not consume upstream machine contracts. | Unit tests pass; model roundtrips through serialization. |
| **L2** | Contract-backed | The capability consumes a Vityo-owned adapter contract. Upstream may be stubbed, but the contract shape is stable. | Adapter contract consumption test passes; capability gap returns structured blocked reason when upstream is absent. |
| **L3** | Product Workflow | The capability is wired into the product shell: UI consumes the model, commands route through the registry, and at least one end-to-end workflow completes. | Widget/integration test for the full workflow; command palette entry functional. |
| **L4** | Cross-platform Reliable | The capability works on all target platforms (Desktop, Android, iOS cloud, Web hosted). Degradation on unsupported platforms is explicit and non-crashing. | Platform matrix test; blocked/unavailable state renders without crash on each platform. |
| **L5** | Styio-native Differentiated | The capability exploits Styio language properties (visual substitution, semantic blocks, minimal compilable unit, runtime graph, Styio project graph) in ways that a generic IDE cannot. | Styio-specific behavior test; capability cannot be replicated by a generic LSP client. |

## 4. How to Advance a Capability

1. Identify the current maturity level from this document.
2. Pick the next level's verification gate.
3. Implement the minimum change that satisfies the gate.
4. Add a test that proves the gate is met.
5. Update this document with the new level and evidence.

Never claim a level without the corresponding verification evidence.
